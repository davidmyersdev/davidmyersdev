### Hi. I'm David (he/him). ‚úåüèª

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Doximity](https://work.doximity.com) with a desire to solve real, impactful problems. I love working on Open Source software, and my primary focus in that area is a project called [Octo](https://octo.app).

#### More about Octo

Octo is an Open Source writing/notes app built specifically for knowledge workers. Unlike other Markdown editors, it offers an all-in-one solution with a focus on privacy and security.
